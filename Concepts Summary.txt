Artificial Intelligence (AI) :

    * Father of AI - John McCarthy, Alan Turing 
    * Father of Indian AI - Raj Reddy
    * AI is a branch of Computer Science that deals with the automation of intelligent behaviour.
    * These are the systems that can think like humans,act like humans, think rationally and act rationally.
    * In AI we develop human like programs using data that is useful to solve real life problems and benefit humankind.
    * In short, AI is all about giving intelligence to machines artificially or buliding intelligent entities.


Steps for building AI Models :

    * Data Collection / Gathering Data
    * Data Cleaning / Preprocessing
    * Choose a model/concept - find what algorithms we r gonna use in ML, DL, NLP, CV etc...
    * Model Training
    * Model Evaluation
    * Parameter Tuning 
    * Model prediction


Installing Libraries :

>>> pip install numpy
>>> pip install pandas==2.1.1   -> Installing with version
>>> pip install opencv-contrib-python
>>> pip install imutils
>>> pip install pyautogui
>>> pip install 


Version check :

>>> pandas.__version__


Importing Libraries :

>>> import pandas
>>> import cv2


Uninstalling Libraries :

>>> pip uninstall pandas


COMPUTER VISION (CV) :

    CV enables machines to see, understand, and process visual information, such as images and videos. 

    Libraries in CV :

        * opencv
        * pillow
        * scikit images
        * Mahotas
        * Scipy


Syntax in Opencv :

    Read Image - cv2.imread('Image_Name/path')    # src

    Write Image - cv2.imwrite('Give name and format eg: photo.jpg', src)

    Show Image - cv2.imshow('Give name', src)  

    Convert to grey image - cv2.cvtColor(src, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    Resize Image - imutils.resize(src, width=500)

    Gausssian Blur - cv2.GaussianBlur(src, (Kernel), bordertype)

    Threshold - cv2.threshold(src, threshold, max value for threshold, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]

    Drawing Rectangle - cv2.rectangle(img, startpoint, endpoint, color, thickness)

    Text - cv2.putText(src, text, position, font, font_size, color, thickness)

    Finding Contours - cv2.findContours(src.copy(), cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, CV2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    Convert to HSV - cv2.cvtColor(src,cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

    Draw Minimum Enclosing Circle - cv2.minEnclosingCircle(countour_Area)

    Drawing Circle - cv2.circle(src, (x,y), int(radius), color, thickness)





Haar Cascade FrontalFace Algorithm :

* It is based on the HAAR WAVELET TECHNIQUE to ANALYZE PIXELS in the image INTO SQUARES by function.
* It uses ML techniques to get degree of ACCURACY.
* This uses "integral image" concepts to compute the "FEATURES" detected.
* Haar Cascade use the ADABOOST LEARNING ALGORITHM which selects SMALL NUMBER OF IM PORTANT FEATURES FROM A LARGE SET to give an efficient result of classifiers.


Fisherface Recognizer :

* Fisherface algorithm extracts PRINCIPLE COMPONENTS that separates one individual from another.
* So, an individual's features cant dominate another person's features.
* Fisherface method will be applied to generate FEATURE VECTOR of facial image data used by the system and then to match vector of traits of training image with vector characteristic of test image using EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE FORMULA.
